I m resuming this great article read in this meduim post

https://medium.com/@shairez/angular-testing-tip-the-easiest-way-to-start-your-test-1f7b6c02fd2

in less than 10 lines when testing we have to focus on 3 tasks
 // this should end in 17 :p
initialisation : 1 question : I m getting What I believe that I m asking for ( builder, factory, persist then read, marshal unmarshal ) // two long sentence 2 line worth :D

invocation : 1 question : is my logic well respected? try to check that your method is resolving the issue correctly

event : 2 question : thread safety ? how is my the result when there is interaction
                     observable, messaging ? is an event driven design well serving ? is my focus triggered well ? mouse click :)
                     
ok enjoy the end :)
NB: dont test every thing focus only on ( TDD, or what varies) to detect new release issues :)
